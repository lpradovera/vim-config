# My .vim directory

After cloning, use:

  cd ~/.vim
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cd ~
  ln -s .vimrc .vim/vimrc

Command-T does not work on Debian 6 AFAIK.
On OSX Snow Leopard, use:

  cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t
  rake make

to enable Command-T.
If you are using RVM, remember to go back to the system ruby for this step with:
  
  rvm use system

After making Command-T you can obviously go back to your normal Ruby.
